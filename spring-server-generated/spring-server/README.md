# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/  

Change default port value in application.properties

http://localhost:8080/v2/oauth/authorize?client_id=tonr&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/tonr2/sparklr/photos&response_type=code&scope=read%20write&state=7Fp6xO


http://localhost:8080/h2-console
http://localhost:8080/api/


You have to initialize the data directory by running the following command
mysqld --initialize [with random root password]
mysqld --initialize-insecure [without random root password]


mysqld --initialize-insecure
mysqld.exe --console
